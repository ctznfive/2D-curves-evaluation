# 2D curves evaluation application

### A small program in Java that implement support of 2D curves hierarchy.
1. Supports two types of 2D geometric curves â€“ lines and ellipses. Each curve returns a 2D point and a first derivative (2D vector) per parameter t along the curve.
2. Populates a container of objects of these types created with random or fixed parameters.
3. Prints coordinates of points and derivatives of all curves in the container at t=PI/4.

#### Curve definitions:
- All curves are parametrically defined, i.e. a point is calculated using some C(t) formula.
- Line is defined by its origin point O and direction D: C(t) = O + D*t.
- Ellipse is defined by its two radii, along X and Y axes.
